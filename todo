todo:
friday: organize data; upload to github; upload to mediafire
saturday: more organization
monday: get number of masks for each image; wrap logging; det. approp method for getting epoch, loss, loss_test and lr.
        1. use this
            `nmasks = np.array([label[0].max() for label in train_flows])
            nremove = (nmasks < min_train_masks).sum()`
           code segment to get nmasks for each image. This is from models.train
        2. read through core._train_net
           grab epoch, loss, loss_test, lr. (net instance?)
tuesday: implement method to get epoch, loss, loss_test, lr. and -> to
